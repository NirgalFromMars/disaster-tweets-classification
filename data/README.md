# Data

This folder contains the original datasets downloaded from the [Kaggle Disaster Tweets competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

- `train.csv`: Labeled tweets used for training.
- `test.csv`: Unlabeled tweets used for generating predictions.

These files were uploaded to AWS S3 and then loaded into RDS (PostgreSQL) as the initial step of the project.
